    <p class="text-rentals">As the current emergency situation changes, our fulfillment teams are continually updating
        operating procedures to protect our associates and customers from the spread of this virus.</p>
    <p class="text-rentals">• If anyone on our staff feels ill or is exhibiting any of the symptoms of the COVID-19
        virus, they have been instructed to immediately go home and seek medical assistance. Under no circumstances is
        an employee to remain in the workplace or on jobsites if they are not feeling well.   <br />• We have equipped
        our Frontline Teams with sanitizers and disinfectant wipes, we’ve asked them to wash their hands regularly and
        avoid close contact with team members and the public (maintain social distancing of 6 feet). We’ve also
        instituted a “no handshake policy” indefinitely.<br />• We will be limiting the number of crew members in our
        company trucks to accommodate proper social distancing.<br />• Should you require our services, please let us
        know if you have any special requests or requirements for our staff on your sites, so we maintain a safe
        workplace for all.</p>
