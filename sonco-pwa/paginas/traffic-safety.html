              A barricade is a permanent or temporary barrier designed to control the movement of people or vehicles. The goal is to either lead them into specific areas or keep them out of designated zones. The specific purpose of a barricade is dependent on the setting and goals. For example, a roadside construction project will require different barricades than an indoor concert venue.<br/>That’s why SONCO provides a wide range of reliable, versatile, and feature-rich barriers that span industries and requirements.
