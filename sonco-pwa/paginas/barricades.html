        A steel barricade is only as strong as its maker, and a heavy-duty aluminum barrier needs to be
        constructed to the highest standards of longevity. Online, you’ll see a wide range of crowd control
        barriers for sale, but none can compete with SONCO’s commitment to unrivaled safety and security.

          <p>
            <br />
            A barricade is a permanent or temporary barrier designed to control the movement of people
            or vehicles. The goal is to either lead them into specific areas or keep them out of
            designated zones. The specific purpose of a barricade is dependent on the setting and goals.
            For example, a roadside construction project will require different barricades than an
            indoor concert venue.<br />That’s why SONCO provides a wide range of reliable, versatile,
            and feature-rich barriers that span industries and requirements. When it comes to keeping
            things within designated areas, we have you covered

      <h2 class="sc-ind-description">What Makes SONCO Barricades Different?</h2>
      <p>
        Every barricade that you find at the SONCO store was developed in-house based on field research,
        industry feedback, and extensive testing. We don’t go based on the minimum guidelines – our goal is
        to produce the best of the best that outshines any other option on the market. Barricades are
        enormously important components to every construction site and event venue big and small, indoors or
        out. This is a team that understands that fact, ensuring you have exactly what you need, day after
        day, and year after year.
