            <h1 class="privacy-main-title">DELIVERY POLICY</h1>

            <p class="secondary">
                All orders are subject to freight charges which will be provided via a quote. Unless you use your own
                carrier, we will select the best carrier based on the order, destination and delivery time. Orders for
                multiple items may require shipping from different locations. In such cases, it may not be possible to
                deliver all items in one shipment, and we will complete the order in several shipments. Multiple shipping
                and handling charges may apply. It is your responsibility to have someone onsite to unload the delivery. If
                you do not have a loading dock or forklift to unload the order, you must request a lift-gate at the time you
                receive your quote. Any special arrangements made with the delivery company will carry extra charges and it
                is your responsibility to settle those fees with them. IMPORTANT: INSPECT ALL PACKAGES AND NOTE ANY DAMAGES
                OR SHORTAGES ON THE SHIPPING DOCUMENTS BEFORE SIGNING - Without a notation of damage, we are unable to file
                a claim against the shipping carrier and may be unable to provide a replacement.
            </p>
            <h1 class="privacy-main-title">DAMAGES</h1>

            <p class="secondary">
                IMPORTANT: INSPECT ALL PACKAGES AND NOTE ANY DAMAGES OR SHORTAGES ON THE SHIPPING DOCUMENTS BEFORE SIGNING -
                Without a notation of damage, we are unable to file a claim against the shipping carrier and may be unable
                to provide a replacement. Unfortunately, due to reasons beyond our control, damage to the material could
                occur during shipment. We will replace any damaged or incorrect material as quickly and efficiently as
                possible. It is the customerâ€™s responsibility to inspect packages. If you are unable to inspect everything
                due to daylight or time constraints, EXCEPTION must be marked on the signed documents and any problems must
                be reported within 48 hours to 95 Traffic Safety Supply and the freight company. Please take digital photos
                of any damages if possible. This will make freight claims faster and help us in our continued effort to
                improve our packaging procedures.
            </p>
            <h1 class="privacy-main-title">PICK-UPS</h1>

                prior to pickup date. Customers that pick up orders are required to pay any applicable state sales tax.

                There is a minimum 15% restocking fee and the customer is responsible for all round-trip freight charges.
                After the product has been inspected and the return has been approved, we will issue a refund in the same

                manner suitable for return shipment without damage. The customer is responsible for any damage incurred
