                        This program works just like your credit card. All orders made in a calendar month get
                        summarized in an end of month statement that is sent to your inbox. You’ll be able to pay with a
                        single bank transfer or check.

                        QUESTIONS. WE&rsquo;VE GOT ANSWERS.</span> FAQ</h2>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What is Apruve ?</strong></span><br /><span
                        style="font-size: medium;"> Apruve is a partner that helps us manage our invoicing and credit
                        program.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What kind of payment terms do you
                            offer?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Our standard terms are: Net 30
                        and End of the Month/Net 15 (consolidated invoices)</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>How large are the credit lines?</strong></span><br /><span
                        style="font-size: medium;"> We don't have a limit on what can be requested. However, we'd
                        encourage you to think through your purchasing needs on a monthly basis and put in a reasonable
                        figure. Your final limit may be higher or lower.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Can my credit line be increased?</strong></span><br /><span
                        style="font-size: medium;"> Yes, We can ask for an increase on your behalf or you can contact
                        Apruve directly to do this using support@apruve.com. It is best if you request an increase after
                        you have placed a few orders to demonstrate a payment/order history.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What information is asked on the credit
                            application?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Apruve asks for very
                        standard information about your business. If the customer goes through the second underwriter,
                        they will be asked to submit 3 months of bank statements.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>How long does the approval process
                            take?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Typically, 2 business days for
                        the first underwriter, though this can take longer if the request is large enough to require the
                        submission of additional documents. The second underwriters can take 5 business days if bank
                        statements are sent via email.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>What if I need a large credit line?</strong></span><br /><span
                        style="font-size: medium;"> For larger requests (typically, those over $50K), we will reach out
                        to you directly to obtain more information. This could include your financials or any
                        project/job information that may be requiring a larger limit size.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Can I add other associates to our account if we're
                            approved?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Yes. Once your name is
                        approved, you can add as many members as you like. You can also assign them specific roles:
                        Buyer - can purchase, does not receive invoices; Payer - can purchase, does receive invoices;
                        Admin - can purchase, receives invoices and can add other members.</span></p>
