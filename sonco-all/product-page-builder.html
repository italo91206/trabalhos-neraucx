                    SONCO barricades were used by the Secret Service at the 2016 Presidential Inauguration, one of the most high-profile events of the decade. Needless to say, the security needs were extremely high, and heavy-duty interlocking steel barricades were essential. So too was choosing the most reliable, highest quality crowd control company in the industry: SONCO.
